# Technology, efficiency, leisure

[[Technology]]

The primary goal of technological advancement should be to increase people's efficiency so that they have more leisure time.

The speaker contends that technological advances that improve our efficiency have ironically resulted in less leisure time, and a pace of life that seems more hurried and frantic than ever.
While I agree that leisure time is declining as a result of efficiencies that technology has brought about, whether the irony to which the speaker refers is real or imagined depends on what one considers to be the chief aim of technology.

Few would disagree that technology has enhanced the speed and efficiency with which we travel, prepare our food, plan and coordinate projects, and communicate with one another.
And the empirical evidence that as a society we are more pressed for time than ever before is convincing indeed.
In 1960, the average U.S.
family included only one breadwinner, who worked just over 40 hours per week.
Since then, the average workweek has increased steadily to nearly 60 hours today.
In fact, in most families there are now two breadwinners who, for lack of leisure time, must delegate food preparation to fast-food workers and child care to professional day-care facilities.
Even single, childless professionals today are so harried that they have no time to seek out romance and must rely instead on matchmaker services.

What explains the irony--this decline in leisure despite increasing efficiency that new technologies have brought about? I agree that technology itself is the culprit.
We use the additional free time that technology affords us not for leisure but rather for work.
As computer technology enables greater and greater office productivity, it also raises our employers' expectations--or demands--for production.
Further technological advances breed still greater efficiency and, in turn, expectations.
Our spiraling workload is only exacerbated by the competitive business environment in which nearly all of us work today.
Moreover, every technological advance demands our time and attention--in order to learn how to use the new technology.
Time devoted to keeping pace with technology depletes time for leisure activities.

Yet, upon further reflection, this apparent irony does not seem so ironic after all.
The final objectives of technology have little to do with affording us more leisure time.
Rather, there are far more vital concerns that technology seeks to address.
Advances in biotechnology can help cure and prevent diseases; advances in medical technology can allow for safer, less invasive diagnosis and treatment; advances in genetics can help prevent birth defects; advances in engineering and chemistry can improve the structural integrity of our buildings, roads, bridges, and vehicles; information technology enables education; and communications technology facilitates global participation in the democratic process.

In sum, the claim that the same technology that breeds efficiency also robs us of our leisure is simply wrongheaded.
At the end of our hectic day, we have not been robbed at all.
Instead, we've ultimately chosen our frantic pace--trading off leisure in pursuit of our health, our safety, our education, and our freedom.
