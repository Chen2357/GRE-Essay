[[Nature]]

Society should make efforts to save endangered species only if the potential extinction of those species is the result of human activities.

There is little justification for society to make extraordinary efforts — especially at a great cost in money and jobs — to save endangered animal or plant species.
(041/[[Statement]])

Some people believe that society should try to save every plant and animal species, despite the expense to humans in effort, time, and financial well-being.
