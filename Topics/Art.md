## Value of art

Consider the issue presented in [[055-Art funding, citizen needs]].
In times of economic crisis, when citizens are grappling with issues like hunger and unemployment, should government suspend funding for the arts?

### Proponents of suspending arts funding

Supporters of suspending arts funding during crises may argue that art is not essential to the survival of citizens.
Allocating limited resources to address urgent needs can directly alleviate suffering and ultimately provide far greater benefits.

Another point of view is that art should not be funded in the first place, and that art should be motivated intrinsically.
The economic crisis would only make such unfunded art more valuable.
This point of view is related to the issue presented in [[134-Funding, art integrity]].
One can point to the fact that authoritarian regimes often use arts as propaganda, which is an example of how government funding of the arts can contaminate the integrity of art.
One may also suspect that artists might deliberately meet the taste of the government in order to secure funding.

### Proponents of maintaining arts funding

On the other hand, proponents of maintaining arts funding during difficult times may emphasize that arts contribute to the well-being and resilience of a society.
Solidarity among society members is especially crucial during times of crisis.
One may point to historical evidence that support the idea that art binds people together during hardship.
For example, that authoritarian regimes often see the need to control arts is an indication of the power of arts on society.

Countering the argument that art's integrity is threatened by government funding ([[134-Funding, art integrity]]), one may point to the fact that in the Renaissance period in Europe, art was funded by the church and by wealthy patrons.
This fact does not seem to have compromised the integrity of art.
As another example, it is possible for government to fund art without interfering with the content of the art.
This has been done during the Great Depression in the United States, when the government funded the Federal Art Project, which commissioned arts with virtually no restrictions on content.

Consider the issue presented in [[033-Art must be understandable]].
In order to have merit, does any work of art must be understandable to most people?
The claim presented in the issue to too extreme to be defensible.

One may argue that understanding is not necessary by pointing to the fact the objective of some works of art is not to be understood.
For example, the objective of music is not to challenge the listener's knowledge of music theory.
It is highly unlikely that composers of music would attempt to convey a message without words or visual images.
A more realistic view is that music is simply an encounter--an experience to be accepted at face value for its aural impact on our spirit and our emotions.

There is a balance between understanding and abstraction.
On the one hand, if the test for meritorious art were its ability to be clearly understood by every observer, then our most valuable art would simply imitate the mundane physical world around us.
This is simply not how our society perceive art.
We value art that is abstract and creative, not just those exhibiting realism.

When it comes to poetry, song, and prose, where the use of language is central to the art, one must confess that the use of language to convey cognitive ideas is important.
However, the final objective even of literature is to move the reader emotionally and spiritually--not simply to inform.
Understanding is only a tool to achieve this objective, not the objective itself.

## Artistic talent

Consider the issue presented in [[141-Creativity fields, talents]].
Does success in creative fields primarily require hard work and perseverance, or innate talents that cannot be learned?

This prompt is tricky because most people would agree that both hard work and talent are important.
One can question the existence of innate talents that cannot be learned.
