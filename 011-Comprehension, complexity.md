[[Science]]

As we acquire more knowledge, things do not become more comprehensible, but more complex and mysterious. (011/[[Statement]])

Some people believe that scientific discoveries have given us a much better understanding of the world around us.
Others believe that science has revealed to us that the world is infinitely more complex than we ever realized.
