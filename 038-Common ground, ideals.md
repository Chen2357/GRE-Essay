Is the proper goal of politics to pursue not an ideal but rather a reasonable consensus, as the speaker maintains?
I concede that pursuing consensus is to be preferred over pursuing illegitimate ideals.
Otherwise, I find the speaker's position troubling.
It ignores the fact that a political ideal might be consensus itself, or require some measure of consensus, and it flies in the face of the nature of politics and of human nature.

The primary reason for my disagreement with the speaker's position is that reasonable consensus and a political ideal need not be mutually exclusive.
In the first place, if one adopts the view that the ultimate goal of public politics should be to achieve the ideal of peace among nations, then attaining a reasonable consensus among nations on issues germane to world peace would be, in essence, to achieve this ideal--at least tentatively.
In the second place, in order to gain the opportunity to pursue their ideals, politicians must build some measure of consensus along the way.
Politics is a business born not only of idealism but also of pragmatism.
In order to be effective, a politician must gain and hold onto political power, which in turn requires some degree of pandering and compromising to build a consensus of support for the politician's agendas.
Modern politics is replete with ideal-promoters who refused to find common ground upon which most people can agree, thereby never affording themselves the chance to pursue their ideals in a way that might make a difference.

Another reason why I tend to disagree with the speaker's position is that it flies in the face of human nature and the nature of politics.
History informs us that, for better or worse, it is human nature to disagree and to dominate or be dominated.
The harsh truth is that achieving consensus is just as illusory as other ideals that politicians typically espouse.
Moreover, politics inherently involves a tug-of-war between conflicting interests.
Those inclined to achieve complete consensus are not true political animals.
True politicians thrive instead on conflict and on advocating certain agendas while fighting to quash others.
Thus, to assert that politics should strive for consensus is to deny the nature of politics and of politicians.

A third problem with the speaker's position is that it begs the question: What are the proper ideals for politicians? They have little to do with consensus, and everything to do with justice and fairness.
It is idealists--not consensus seekers--who sway the masses, incite revolutions, and make political ideology reality.
Consider idealists such as America's founders, or Mahatma Gandhi, or Martin Luther King.
Had these idealists concerned themselves with consensus building rather than with their notions of an ideal society, the United States and India might still be British colonies, and African Americans might still be relegated to the backs of buses.
This is not to say that pursuing idealism is necessarily preferable to pursuing consensus.
After all, legitimate ideals require a certain measure of morality--that is, they must further humanity's best interests.
Consider the many idealists, such as Stalin and Hitler, who most people would agree were egregious violators of human rights.
Ultimately, such leaders forfeit their leadership as a result of their illegitimate ideals and means of pursuing those ideals.

Finally, lacking idealism, a political leader will tend to seek compromise and reasonable consensus for its own sake.
It seems that pure pragmatism breeds a sort of unprincipled self-serving that unfortunately pervades contemporary politics.
Most politicians seem driven today by their interest in being elected and reelected--that is, in short-term survival--rather than by any sense of mission or even obligation to their constituency or country.
All too often, diplomatic and legal maneuverings and negotiations are intended to meet the practical needs of the parties involved: minimizing costs, preserving options, and so forth.
Idealists are better able to steer clear of short-term thinking, near-sighted goals, and self-serving maneuverings.

In sum, the speaker's call for consensus is ill-conceived.
It ignores the fact that consensus is a necessary means to achieving political ideals, if not part-and-parcel of those ideals.
Moreover, politicians are not by nature consensus seekers, nor are humans by nature inclined to consensus.
In the final analysis, the statement is wrongheaded; what politics is about, and should be about, is the pursuit of ideals that accord with the shared interests of all humanity.
